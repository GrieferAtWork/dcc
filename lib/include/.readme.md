Default (and minimal) C standard library optimized for DCC
These headers are still meant to be used in conjunction with /lib/fixinclude
Note, that using these headers is fully optional, as they have been designed to act as a second abstraction layer between DCC and the host's system include path:

#1: [REQUIRED] -/dcc/lib/fixinclude
#2: [OPTIONAL] -/dcc/lib/include
#3: [SYSTEM]    /usr/include
